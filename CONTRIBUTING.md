## General guidelines
Here are some things to keep in mind for all types of contributions:

- Follow the ["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) workflow.
- Fill out the checked-in pull request template when opening pull requests. Note related issues and tag maintainers.
- Ensure your PR passes build and testing checks before requesting a review.
   - If you would like comments or feedback, please open an issue or discussion and tag a maintainer.
- Backwards compatibility is key. Your changes must not be breaking, except in case of critical bug and security fixes.
- Look for duplicate PRs or issues that have already been opened before opening a new one.
- Keep scope as isolated as possible. As a general rule, your changes should not affect more than one package at a time.

### Priorities
All [issues](https://github.com/czelabueno/jai-workflow/issues) are prioritized by maintainers. These will be reviewed in order of priority, with bugs being a higher priority than new features.

We have organized releases by year QUARTER. All features and bug fixes will be released progressively for testing and feedback in the corresponding quarter.

For example, the Q1-25 is planned to release the following feature list and we expect PRs related to these features to be merged by the end of Q1-25. The list is as follows:

#### Q1 2025 Features
- **Graph-Core**:
   - Split Nodes
   - Merge Nodes
   - Parallel transitions
   - Human-in-the-loop
- **Modular (Group of nodes)**:
   - Module
   - Remote Module
- **Integration**:
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration as server and client.
   - Define remote module as MCP server.
- **API**:
   - Publish workflow as API (SSE for streaming runs and REST for sync runs).

### BugFixes
For bug fixes, please open up an issue before proposing a fix to ensure the proposal properly addresses the underlying problem. In general, bug fixes should all have an accompanying unit test that fails before the fix.

### New Features
For new features, please open up an issue before proposing a new feature to ensure the proposal aligns with the project's goals. Fill out the checked-in feature request template.
